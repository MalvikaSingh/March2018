# March2018
1. Updated code using POST Mapping for fetching data from database based on user input.
2. Code for uploading csv file to the database after AES decryption.
March 07-II branch has main class as CryptoUtilTest which takes an input of a csv file. Here, I am encrypting it but in the program with which it is to be integrated, this input stream is already encrypted.
Decryption is done using AES and file is pushed in oracle database.
